# Batty - Battery Threshold CLI

### What this is for
- Batty is meant to be installed and used in tandem with [power-profiles-daemon](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/upower/power-profiles-daemon)
- Do not use this with [TLP](https://github.com/linrunner/TLP) as it can cause unpredictable behavior. Usually TLP can solve this however for projects like Omarchy, Batty can work in substitute, which inspired me to build a working solution.
